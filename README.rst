Thermodynamics-informed machine learning model
--------

This repository accompanies the paper presenting "Thermodynamics-informed machine learning to predict temperature-dependent properties of fluids". By combining established physics-based equations, such as the Arrhenius equation, with machine learning models, this approach encodes temperature dependence directly into the predictive framework. The model predicts the chemistry-dependent coefficients of equation, enabling accurate and generalizable predictions across diverse chemistries and temperature ranges. The methodology has been validated using experimental and benchmarked against two different base models.
